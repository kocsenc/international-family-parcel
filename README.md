# international-family-parcel
Tool to help keep track of packages that have been ordered from other people to your house.

As an international student in the US, it is really annoying when you go home. Not because of awkward family dinners, but because many people begin asking for things. Yes, the US has awesome stuff. In fact many electronics are cheaper in the US than off-shore. With this tool, you can self-host a little service to redirect family.

# Main Feature Set

A `client` is an `offshore family member` in this context.
- Client can create an order
- Order will have necessary infomration (tracking, price, ETA)
- Service will provide with current shipping address (clients are expected to pay for and ship the items)
- Service can/will deny addition of more packages based on package quota & or time.
- Service will show updates of the order such as [pics, arrival time, delivery status ...]
- Service will show delivery method to client
- Service will use data to hook into awesome shipping API's.
- Internationalization (duh!)

Still not decided. Pondering...
